Project Overview  
The **"[Precious Metals Data Analysis](https://github.com/ChimaOkeke/Precious-Metals-Data-Analyst)"** Power BI project offers a detailed exploration of historical and market data for key metals—**Gold**, **Silver**, **Platinum**, and **Palladium**. By transforming complex datasets into clear and dynamic visualizations, this project empowers analysts and investors to monitor pricing trends, compare metals, assess volatility, and make informed investment decisions in the commodities market.

**Key Features:**

5. **Metal Comparison & Correlation:**  
   Evaluate how these metals perform relative to each other using multi-line normalized charts and a correlation heatmap. Visual comparisons allow users to uncover patterns, correlations, and divergences between asset classes.

6. **Volatility & Risk Metrics:**  
   Assess investment risk using standard deviation visuals, high-low range indicators, and optional risk index gauges. Identify high-risk/high-reward scenarios across different metals.

7. **Forecasting & Trend Decomposition:**  
   Predict future price trends with Power BI’s forecasting tools. Break down patterns into trend, seasonality, and randomness for better strategic foresight.

8. **Interactive Exploration:**  
   Apply filters for metal type, date range, or metric, and use dynamic tooltips to gain contextual insights. Drill-through features offer deeper analytical layers without overwhelming the dashboard.
